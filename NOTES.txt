NOTES

June 14, 2016

When the homepage (login) is opened in a new machine (not local machine), the page is reloaded multiple time continuously for a few minutes until it works fine
http://10.1.21.59/montessori

localhost is used to specify the database connect, must be changed if database is not local host

//if this is not login page, then load it
if (strpos($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"], "/montessori/login.php") === false)
