NOTES

June 14, 2016

When the homepage (login) is opened in a new machine (not local machine), the page is reloaded multiple time continuously for a few minutes until it works fine
http://10.1.21.59/montessori

localhost is used to specify the database connect, must be changed if database is not local host

//if this is not login page, then load it
if (strpos($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"], "/montessori/login.php") === false)


PHP code is always executed by server

remember to close all tags if function terminates before its end

1. grouping (green, yellow to arrange lunch, ...)
2. print out attendance summary of students for parent approvals
3. student-teachear schedule to suggest schedules (schedule only made by boss)
4. medical/allergy special notes for kids
5. working hours and payments (per week, per two week, ...) based on check in/out
